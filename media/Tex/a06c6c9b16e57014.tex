A more formal discussion of the limitations of 
        physical properties involves recognizing that 
        every property has a representation as a subspace 
        of some extended Hilbert space, with either a 
        finite or uncountably infinite set of basis vectors
        called eigenvectors, each associated with an eigenvalue.
        Each eigenvalue represents a physically measurable quantity.
